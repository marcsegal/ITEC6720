Its host star gets periodically fainter whenever the planet is in front of the star. Because there are multiple phenomena that can create a signal that looks similar to a planetary transit, the candidates have to be confirmed with another method. For Kepler-28 the planetary nature of the companions has been confirmed by transit timing variations, caused by other planets in the system, and a stability analysis.

It was discovered in TESS data by Ment et al. in 2020, supported by ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team. Based on the observed mass-radius distribution of small exoplanets at similar insolations the planet is likely terrestrial. It's close proximity to Earth make it an alluring target to study atmospheric erosion due to the strong X-ray emission from the star. It is also among the most accessible targets for transmission and emission spectroscopy and eclipse photometry with JWST.",TOI-540 b
